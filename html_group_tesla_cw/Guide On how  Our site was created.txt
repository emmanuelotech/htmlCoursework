1. How did you come up with the Homepage?

>> Our site is divided into TWO FRAMES --> TWO ROWS
 First Frame contains:
 VU logo: We used image tag. <img src = "Vu logo">
 Group Name: Use H1 tag 
 "Back to home button": We used button tag.
 "Back to home" button --> Refreshes the page so that we can see the gallery of members.

Creating a button: 
we used the <button> Back to Home</button>

SECOND FRAME (SECOND ROW)
>> contains two frames. 
>> One frame contains the Members list --> Left hand side linked to their  biographies
>> Second frame contains gallery of members linked to their biographies


Briefly explain the structure of an html document?
Every webpage or html document has the following structure.

Declaration that is <!Doctype html>: Tells the browser which html version to be used and the code to be rendered and parsed in.

<head></head> tags
<title><title> : Title of the document.
<footer></footer>
<body></body : All content goes here -> graphics (images, videos), texts, button


HOW WE CREATED THE GALLERY?
We used table : 

<table>
 <tr></tr> #From Emma--> flavia:#pictures
<tr></tr> #From Emma--> flavia:#Names

<tr></tr> #From Grace--> Amon:#pictures
<tr></tr> #From Grace--> Amon:#Names

</table>

We used <td></td> to put both the pictures and the Names





Explain the different btn <div> and <span>
<div></div> Tag is used to tagged specific sections. We can allocate id to unique identify an element or section while styling.
or class to identify a group.



ANY OTHER BUSINESS >>  AT YOUR OWN RISK.
<span> </span> is used to markup a part of text.

rowspan: is used to merge rows table
colspan: is used to merge columns of a table

What is the purpose of the <meta>tag?
meta tag provides information about the website
OR-->defines the metadata about HTML document

Different between:
inline css :- <p style="color:red">Flavia</p> : -> Exactly put on the element's opening tag.

internal css: Internal CSS is always put in the head tag of that particular webpage or html document.

<html>
<head>
	<title>bbc world service</title>

	<style>
		p{color:red} --> Internal CSS --> On the head of the webpage.
	</style>

	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="myStyling.css">

</head>

	<body>
	<p style="color:red"> That latest about Sensational Ug</p> :Inline css
	</body>

</html>

external css --> Always another file saved with a .css file name extension
